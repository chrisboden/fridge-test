# Fridge Temperature Tester

A KiCad project for testing fridge temperatures. This project contains the schematic and PCB design files for a temperature monitoring system.

## Project Structure

- `Fridge_Temperature_Tester.pro` - KiCad project file
- `Fridge_Temperature_Tester.sch` - Schematic file
- `Fridge_Temperature_Tester.kicad_pcb` - PCB layout file
- `Fridge_Temperature_Tester.lib` - Project-specific component library

## Development

This project is developed using KiCad EDA. To open and modify the project:

1. Install KiCad
2. Open the `.pro` file in KiCad
3. Use the Schematic Editor (Eeschema) to view/edit the schematic
4. Use the PCB Editor (Pcbnew) to view/edit the PCB layout
